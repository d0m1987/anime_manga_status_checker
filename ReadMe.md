[Analysis of my favorite anime pages html structure](./docs/analysis/analysis_anime_pages.md)

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to provide a website that gives you the ability to define XPATH values and be notified when they change.
The original purpose I started this project was to get notified of new anime / manga episodes I periodically check. Then I realized, that the idea can be made more generically and thus the project was changed to be a wider checker.  
If you like other mangas / animes / ..., please feel free to suggest further pages or better: directly create a pull request.
